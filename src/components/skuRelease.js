        In order to properly display a model on your PDP, it is necessary to
        know the SKU of the product to display. Vertebraeâ€™s Implementation
        Engineers require a method to determine the active SKU on a PDP. The
        active SKU is often determined by a combination of color, size, and
        other preferences that make up an item. For all combinations, the proper
        SKU of the model must be scrapeable.

      <p>
        Highlighted above the SKU of the current product is visible inline in
        the HTML. Vertebrae Implementation Engineers can web scrape this SKU
        inside the current active swatch.

      />
      <p>
        The SKU needs to match 1:1 with the SKU listed within AXIS, so that a
        model is properly loaded.
